# Project-Minerva-LinkedIn-Scraper
A tool to increase productivity for professionals looking for industry leaders/experts on LinkedIn


This tool is used to look for people with years of experience on particular industries, and extract their profiles to an excel file along with a scoring system. This will enable the user to later review the profiles and sort them based on specific expirience attributes, decreasing the time spent on LinkedIn by the user himself.


# Instructions

1) Update your search terms

2) Update the keywords that you want to be scored for each profile. Keywords are grouped in:
   * Position_Keywords (e.g. Logistics, Ecommerce, Mechanical Engineer, Developer, Python etc)
   * Seniority_Keywords (Senior, Manager get a lower score than Chief Officer or Director)
   * Country_Keywords (you may want to search for a developer in netherlands and score him/her according to that)
   * Company_Keywords (Employees of a specific company may be graded differently)

3) Set the amount of pages per search query you want to look at

All of this depends on your search and is highly customizable. Set it up and let the program return with the relevant profiles, their links, job-positions and scores
